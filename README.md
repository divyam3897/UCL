## Abstract

Continual learning (CL) aims to learn a sequence of tasks without forgetting the previously acquired knowledge. However, recent advances in continual learning are restricted to supervised continual learning (SCL) scenarios. Consequently, they are not scalable to real-world applications where the data distribution is often biased and unannotated. In this work, we focus on *unsupervised continual learning (UCL)*, where we learn the feature representations on an unlabelled sequence of tasks and show that the reliance on annotated data is not necessary for continual learning. We conduct a systematic study analyzing the learned feature representations and show that unsupervised visual representations are surprisingly more robust to catastrophic forgetting, consistently achieve better performance, and generalize better to out-of-distribution tasks than SCL. Furthermore, we find that UCL achieves a smoother loss landscape through qualitative analysis of the learned representations and learns meaningful feature representations.
Additionally, we propose Lifelong Unsupervised Mixup (Lump), a simple yet effective technique that leverages the interpolation between the current task and previous tasks' instances to alleviate catastrophic forgetting for unsupervised representations.

__Contribution of this work__
- We attempt to bridge the gap between continual learning and representation learning and tackle the two important problems of continual learning with unlabelled data and representation learning on a sequence of tasks.
- Systematic quantitative analysis show that UCL achieves better performance over SCL with significantly lower catastrophic forgetting on Sequential CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet. Additionally, we evaluate on out of distribution tasks and few-shot continually learning demonstrating the expressive power of unsupervised representations. 
- We provide visualization of the representations and loss landscapes that UCL learns discriminative, human perceptual patterns and achieves a flatter and smoother loss landscape. Furthermore, we propose Lifelong Unsupervised Mixup (Lump) for UCL, which effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and provides better qualitative interpretations.
